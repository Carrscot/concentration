# Concentration

Welcome to concentration! This was built to assess my skills as a developer. This version inludes all the features I was able to create within the time given for the assessment but I will be adding to it in the future when I learn more about scaling for smaller devices and how to properly integrate back end into REACT Apps.

To run this web app remotely simply access it throught this link: https://concentration-7zpr.vercel.app/

If you would like to run it locally:
- fork the repo to your machine
- navigate to the directory you forked the repo into
- Open the folder in your IDE of choice
- Open a terminal
- In your terminal run the command 'npm install' to install all missing node packages.
- run the command 'npm run dev"
- Enter http://localhost:5173/ into your browser.

Before you can play both players must enter their names.

The game is simple. Each player takes it in turn to turn over 2 cards. If the number and color of the card match that player gets a point. The palyer with the most points after all the cards have been turned over wins!

For your reference the basic outline of how I went about designing the app can be found below as well as features I still intend to add when I have the time.

Until then please enjoy!
